# Problem

An integer _`d`_ is a divisor of an integer _`n`_ if the remainder of _`n / d =`_ `0`.

Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

**Note:** Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same digit should be counted (e.g. for _`n = 111`_, `1` is a divisor of `111` each time it occurs so the answer is `3`).
