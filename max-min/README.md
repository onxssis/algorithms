# Problem

You will be given a list of integers, `arr`, and a single integer `k`. You must create an array of length `k` from elements of `arr` such that its unfairness is minimized. Call that array `subarr`. Unfairness of an array is calculated as
`max(subarr) - min(subarr)`

where:

- max denotes the largest integer in `subarr`
- min denotes the smallest integer in `subarr`
