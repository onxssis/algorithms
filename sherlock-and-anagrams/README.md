# Problem

Two strings are anagrams of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string. Given a string, find the number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.

For example `s = mom`, the list of all anagrammatic pairs is `[m,m], [mo, om]` at positions `[[0], [2]], [[0, 1], [1, 2]]` respectively.
