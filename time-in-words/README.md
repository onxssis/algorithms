# Problem

Given the time in numerals we may convert it into words, as shown below:

```text
    5:00 -> five o' clock
    5:01 -> one minute past five
    5:10 -> ten minutes past five
    5:15 -> quarter past five
    5:30 -> half past five
    5:40 -> twenty minutes to six
    5:45 -> quarter to six
    5:47 -> thirteen minutes to six
    5:28 -> twenty eight minutes past five
```

At ```minutes = 0```, use o' clock. For ```1 <= minutes <= 30```, use past, and for ```30 < minutes>``` use to. Note the space between the apostrophe and clock in o' clock. Write a program which prints the time in words for the input given in the format described.
